Interested in the development of generalized learning mechanisms in artificial intelligence.

As to how such a mechanism could be obtain, I am not quite sure, however the emerging complexity arising from simpler processes seems like an approach I am interested in. I think at some point human algorithmic design breaks down, which seems to be something the research community often forgets. Of course there is a need for human design on some levels, however the inclusion of bias often reduces the flexibility of learning and design. Can we design learning mechanisms such that both learning and architecural design emerge out the learning agent's own will/evolution? I think so.
